# EasyJet Telos Intelligence Platform Implementation Guide

## Executive Summary

This implementation guide demonstrates how to deploy the Telos Intelligence Platform for EasyJet's sponsored design partnership, transforming overnight data processing into actionable morning intelligence briefings. Think of this as building the "mission control center" for EasyJet's revenue management decisions—centralizing fragmented data streams into a unified intelligence layer that amplifies analyst capabilities rather than replacing them.

```

## Phase 1: Data Enclave Setup (Weeks 1-2)

### 1.1 Database Schema Deployment

Deploy the core schema to support EasyJet's intelligence requirements:

```bash
# Deploy to Databricks SQL Warehouse
databricks sql execute --warehouse-id your-warehouse-id --file airline_intelligence_schema.sql

# Verify table creation
databricks sql execute --warehouse-id your-warehouse-id --query "SHOW TABLES"
```

### 1.2 Data Source Integration

**Infare Competitive Data Integration:**
```python
# Configure Infare data pipeline
infare_config = {
    "source_path": "/mnt/easyjet-data/infare/",
    "file_pattern": "competitive_pricing_*.csv",
    "schedule": "0 2 * * *"  # Daily at 2 AM
}

# Set up Delta Share for real-time access
databricks delta-sharing create-share easyjet-competitive-intelligence
```

**EasyJet Internal Data (Segment Finder + RM Actions):**
```python
# Connect to EasyJet's existing Databricks workspace
easyjet_config = {
    "source_database": "easyjet_rm_production",
    "tables": [
        "segment_finder_outputs",
        "pricing_actions_log", 
        "flight_performance_daily",
        "booking_curve_analysis"
    ]
}
```

### 1.3 Synthetic Data Population

For the POC phase, populate with realistic synthetic data:

```sql
-- Execute the synthetic data generator
-- This creates 30 days of historical data across 10 core EasyJet routes
-- Includes competitive pricing, capacity, search trends, and RM actions
```

## Phase 2: NightShift Intelligence Deployment (Weeks 3-4)

### 2.1 AI Agent Configuration

**Configure Writer AI Integration:**
```python
writer_config = {
    "api_key": "your-writer-api-key",
    "model": "palmyra-x4-enterprise", 
    "context_window": 128000,
    "temperature": 0.3,  # Conservative for financial recommendations
    "safety_settings": "enterprise_strict"
}
```

**Deploy Intelligence Agents:**

1. **Performance Intelligence Agent**
   - Monitors EasyJet route performance vs. plan/LY
   - Detects load factor anomalies and booking curve deviations
   - Analyzes yield performance and ancillary revenue trends

2. **Competitive Intelligence Agent**  
   - Focuses on Ryanair pricing movements (primary competitor)
   - Tracks capacity changes across European LCC competitors
   - Identifies promotional campaigns and schedule adjustments

3. **Demand Intelligence Agent**
   - Processes Skyscanner/Google search volume data
   - Analyzes conversion rate trends and booking intent
   - Correlates external events with demand shifts

4. **External Context Agent**
   - Monitors weather, strikes, regulatory changes
   - Tracks economic indicators affecting travel demand
   - Identifies seasonal patterns and event-driven demand

### 2.2 Overnight Processing Schedule

```python
# Configure NightShift processing schedule
nightshift_schedule = {
    "trigger_time": "02:00 GMT",  # After daily data updates
    "processing_order": [
        "data_validation",
        "performance_agent", 
        "competitive_agent",
        "demand_agent", 
        "external_context_agent",
        "insight_synthesis",
        "briefing_generation"
    ],
    "completion_target": "05:00 GMT"  # Before European business hours
}
```

## Phase 3: Morning Briefing System (Weeks 5-6)

### 3.1 Role-Based Briefing Generation

**RM Manager Briefing (Melissa's Use Case):**

```python
rm_manager_briefing = {
    "executive_summary": "Key overnight findings with 3 bullet points",
    "priority_actions": "Immediate actions requiring attention",
    "competitive_intelligence": {
        "ryanair_movements": "Price changes requiring response",
        "capacity_changes": "Market capacity shifts",
        "promotional_activity": "Competitor sales campaigns"
    },
    "performance_alerts": {
        "load_factor_anomalies": "Routes underperforming expectations", 
        "booking_curve_deviations": "Flights off normal booking pace",
        "yield_optimization_opportunities": "Revenue improvement areas"
    },
    "demand_intelligence": {
        "search_volume_changes": "Significant demand shifts",
        "conversion_rate_trends": "Booking behavior changes",
        "seasonal_adjustments": "Expected vs actual seasonal patterns"
    },
    "focus_recommendations": "Top 3 areas requiring analyst attention"
}
```

### 3.2 Interactive Query Interface

Deploy conversational interface powered by Writer AI:

```python
# Natural language query examples
queries = [
    "Why did load factors drop on LGW-BCN yesterday?",
    "What competitive moves should I be aware of this week?", 
    "Which routes have the best yield optimization opportunities?",
    "How is Ryanair's pricing strategy affecting our bookings?"
]
```

- User satisfaction: NPS score from analyst feedback

**Secondary KPIs:**
- Morning briefing generation time: <15 minutes
- System uptime: 99.9% availability
- Alert precision: Minimize false positives
- Revenue impact: Track decisions driven by insights

### 4.2 Human-in-the-Loop Refinement

```python
# Analyst feedback integration
feedback_loop = {
    "recommendation_rating": "1-5 scale on usefulness",
    "accuracy_validation": "Was the insight correct?",
    "action_taken": "What action did you take based on this?",
    "time_saved": "How much time did this save you?",
    "improvement_suggestions": "What would make this more useful?"
}
```

## Conclusion: The Strategic Impact

The Telos Intelligence Platform represents more than a technological upgrade—it's a transformation from reactive data analysis to proactive intelligence-driven decision making. Like upgrading from radar to satellite guidance, this system provides EasyJet with unprecedented visibility into market dynamics while amplifying analyst capabilities rather than replacing human judgment.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Human-Centric Design:** AI augments analyst expertise rather than replacing it
2. **Actionable Intelligence:** Every insight includes clear recommendations and confidence scoring
3. **Continuous Learning:** System improves through analyst feedback and decision tracking
4. **Business Impact Focus:** ROI measurement drives system evolution and optimization

**Long-term Vision:**
Transform EasyJet into the most data-intelligent airline in Europe, where every commercial decision is informed by comprehensive market intelligence, competitive analysis, and predictive insights. The goal is not just operational efficiency, but sustainable competitive advantage through superior decision-making speed and accuracy.

This implementation creates the foundation for EasyJet to lead the European LCC market not just through cost efficiency, but through intelligence-driven revenue optimization that consistently outperforms competitors in an increasingly dynamic market environment.
