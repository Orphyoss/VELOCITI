Velociti: EasyJet Intelligence Platform
Product Requirements Document (PRD) v1.0
Product Overview

Product Name: Velociti - AI-Powered Revenue Intelligence Platform for EasyJet Product Owner:
Chief Intelligence Officer, Telos Engineering Lead: [TBD] Target Users: EasyJet Revenue
Management Analysts, RM Managers, Commercial Executives

Problem Statement

EasyJet analysts face continuous intelligence challenges throughout the day: 3-4 hours each morning
correlating fragmented overnight data, plus ongoing reactive analysis of real-time competitive moves,
demand shifts, and operational changes. This fragmented approach delays critical pricing decisions
and limits competitive response speed in the fast-moving European LCC market where conditions
change hourly.

Solution Statement

Velociti provides an AI-powered intelligence workbench that operates continuously 24/7, processing
overnight market changes for morning briefings while providing real-time intelligence throughout the
day via conversational AI and specialized analytical agents, reducing morning briefing preparation time
by 61% and total daily analysis time by 40% while improving decision speed and accuracy.

Success Metrics

Primary: 61% reduction in morning briefing preparation time (from 180 minutes to 70 minutes)
Secondary: 2% improvement in network yield within 6 months
Adoption: 85% daily active usage by target analyst population
Accuracy: 90% accuracy on critical competitive intelligence alerts (>£50K revenue impact)
