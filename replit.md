## Recent Changes  
- **CRITICAL: Fixed Missing Production Endpoint** - Identified root cause: /api/telos/rm-metrics endpoint exists in telos.ts router but that router was never mounted; individual endpoints are defined in routes.ts but rm-metrics was missing, added proper endpoint in routes.ts with full database integration and logging (2025-08-04)
